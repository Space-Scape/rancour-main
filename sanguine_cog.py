Looking for a fun Sunday activity? Look no farther than **Sanguine Sunday!**
Spend an afternoon or evening sending **Theatre of Blood** runs with clan members.
The focus on this event is on **Learners** and general KC.

We plan to have mentors on hand to help out with the learners.
A learner is someone who needs the mechanics explained for each room.
